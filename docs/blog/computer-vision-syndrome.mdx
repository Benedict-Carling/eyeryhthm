# Computer Vision Syndrome: The Two-Thirds Problem

If you spend hours staring at screens each day, you're part of a global experiment in human vision. The results are in, and they're not great: **69% of us now experience Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS)**.

<Info>
**What is CVS?** Computer Vision Syndrome encompasses a range of eye and vision-related problems resulting from prolonged screen use, including eyestrain, headaches, dry eyes, and blurred vision.

## The numbers are staggering

A comprehensive meta-analysis published in the *Journal of Optometry* in 2024 pooled data from 103 cross-sectional studies involving over 66,000 participants. The findings paint a clear picture of how widespread this problem has become.<sup>1</sup>

These aren't small differences. If you're a female university student who wears contact lenses, you're in one of the highest-risk groups for digital eye strain.

## Three pathways to discomfort

Researchers have identified three distinct mechanisms through which screen use affects our visual system.<sup>2</sup>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Extraocular (Musculoskeletal)" icon="person">
    Prolonged screen viewing often involves static postures that strain the neck, shoulders, and back. These symptoms frequently co-occur with visual discomfort, suggesting a connected system of strain.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Accommodative (Focus)" icon="eye">
    Your eyes constantly adjust focus when reading on screens. Over time, this can lead to blurred vision, difficulty switching focus between distances, and even double vision. The closer the screen, the harder your eyes work.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Ocular Surface (Dry Eye)" icon="droplet">
    This is perhaps the most common pathway. Reduced blinking, combined with air conditioning and low humidity environments, leads to tear film instability, causing redness, burning, and a gritty sensation.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## The pandemic made it worse

<Warning>
During the COVID-19 pandemic, CVS prevalence reached as high as **94%** in some populations as screen time skyrocketed for remote work and online education.<sup>2</sup>
</Warning>

The shift to remote work didn't just increase screen time; it often degraded viewing conditions. Home setups rarely match the ergonomic standards of office environments, leading to:

- Poor monitor positioning
- Inadequate lighting
- Longer uninterrupted work sessions
- Less opportunity for visual breaks

## Who's most at risk?

The research consistently identifies several risk factors:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Screen time greater than 3 hours daily | 90% of users report symptoms<sup>3</sup> |
| Contact lens wear | 73% vs 64% prevalence |
| Female gender | Higher symptom reporting |
| Younger age (students) | Highest prevalence group |
| Uncorrected vision problems | Compounds strain significantly |

## What you can do about it

The good news is that CVS is largely preventable and treatable. Evidence-based interventions include:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Optimize your environment">
    Position your screen 20-26 inches from your eyes, slightly below eye level. Ensure adequate, glare-free lighting.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Address dry eye">
    Consider a humidifier, use artificial tears, and make conscious efforts to blink fully and frequently.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Take strategic breaks">
    Research supports regular breaks, though the optimal protocol is still debated. More on this in our article on the 20-20-20 rule.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get your vision checked">
    Uncorrected or under-corrected refractive errors significantly worsen CVS symptoms. A prescription optimized for your working distance can help.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
**EyeRhythm helps with this.** By tracking your blink rate in real-time, you can catch the early signs of eye fatigue before symptoms become severe. [Download EyeRhythm](/download) to start monitoring your eye health.
