# Blue Light: Separating Science from Marketing

Blue light blocking glasses have become a billion-dollar industry. Marketing claims range from preventing eye strain to protecting against macular degeneration. But when you look at the actual research, the story is far more nuanced than the ads suggest.

Let's separate what we know from what we're being sold.

## What is blue light, exactly?

Blue light is part of the visible spectrum, with wavelengths between 400-490 nanometers. It's everywhere, not just from screens.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Natural sources" icon="sun">
    Sunlight contains far more blue light than any screen. A sunny day exposes you to 10-100x more blue light than your phone.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Artificial sources" icon="lightbulb">
    LED screens, fluorescent lights, and LED bulbs all emit blue light. Screens are not uniquely problematic compared to modern indoor lighting.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

The concern about blue light centers on two claims: that it causes eye strain/damage, and that it disrupts sleep. Let's examine each.

## Claim 1: Blue light causes eye strain

This is the primary marketing message for blue-blocking glasses. The evidence? Essentially nonexistent.

<Warning>
A 2023 Cochrane systematic review (the gold standard for evidence synthesis) analyzed 17 randomized controlled trials and found **no clinically meaningful difference** in visual fatigue scores between blue-blocking and regular lenses.<sup>1</sup>
</Warning>

The Cochrane review concluded:

> "We found no evidence to support the use of blue-light-filtering spectacle lenses in the general population to improve visual performance or reduce eye fatigue symptoms."

Another comprehensive review reached similar conclusions: there is a "lack of high quality evidence to support using blue-blocking spectacle lenses for the general population."<sup>2</sup>

<Info>
**Why the confusion?** Eye strain from screens is real and common, but it's caused by other factors: reduced blinking, accommodative stress, dry environment, and poor ergonomics. Blue light is a convenient scapegoat, but not the culprit.
</Info>

## Claim 2: Blue light damages your retina

Some marketing suggests blue light from screens could lead to macular degeneration. This claim extrapolates from laboratory studies on isolated cells exposed to intense blue light far exceeding normal screen exposure.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="The lab studies" icon="flask">
    High-intensity blue light can damage retinal cells in petri dishes. But these conditions don't reflect real-world screen use.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="The real-world data" icon="users">
    A 2023 review stated explicitly: "There is no evidence that screen use and LEDs in normal use are deleterious to the human retina, and no evidence of beneficial effects from blue-blocking lenses for AMD prevention."<sup>3</sup>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The intensity of blue light from screens is simply too low to cause retinal damage under normal use conditions.

## Claim 3: Blue light disrupts sleep

Now we get to something actually supported by research. Blue light does affect your circadian rhythm, but the story requires nuance.

### The science is real

A landmark 2015 study published in PNAS had participants use e-readers versus printed books before bed for two weeks.<sup>4</sup> The e-reader group showed:

| Effect | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Melatonin suppression | Significant |
| Circadian phase delay | ~1.5 hours |
| Time to fall asleep | +10 minutes |
| REM sleep | Reduced |
| Next-morning alertness | Decreased |

This happens because specialized cells in your retina (containing melanopsin) detect blue light and signal your brain about daytime. Evening blue light exposure tells your body it's still day.<sup>5</sup>

<Info>
Melanopsin, the photopigment in these cells, has peak sensitivity at **~479 nm** (blue light). This is why blue light specifically affects circadian rhythms more than other wavelengths.
</Info>

### But context matters

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Screen brightness matters more than color" icon="brightness-high">
    The same research shows that overall light intensity has a bigger effect than specific wavelength filtering. Dimming your screen is more effective than adding a blue filter to a bright screen.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Duration matters" icon="clock">
    Brief screen use is unlikely to meaningfully shift your circadian rhythm. Extended evening use (2+ hours) has larger effects.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Individual variation is huge" icon="users">
    Some people are highly sensitive to evening light exposure; others barely notice. Your genetics play a significant role.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Do blue-blocking glasses help with sleep?

The Cochrane review found sleep quality effects were **"indeterminate"** with mixed results across studies.<sup>1</sup> Some showed benefits, others showed none.

<Tip>
**More reliable sleep interventions:**
- Reduce screen brightness in evening
- Enable your device's built-in night mode (reduces blue light AND brightness)
- Maintain consistent sleep/wake times
- Get bright light exposure in the morning
- Stop screen use 30-60 minutes before bed
</Tip>

### What about software filters?

Software like f.lux and Night Shift shifts screen color temperature to reduce blue light. Research results are mixed:

- One study found f.lux improved sleep quality in night shift workers<sup>6</sup>
- Another found "negligible differences" between iPad Night Shift and standard mode<sup>7</sup>

The variability in results suggests these filters help some people under some conditions, but aren't universally effective.

## The bottom line

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="For eye strain" icon="circle-xmark">
    Blue-blocking glasses show no meaningful benefit. Address the real causes: blink rate, breaks, ergonomics, and humidity.
  </Card>
  <Card title="For retinal health" icon="circle-xmark">
    No evidence screens cause damage. No evidence blue-blocking prevents AMD.
  </Card>
  <Card title="For sleep" icon="circle-check">
    Blue light does affect circadian rhythm, but overall light reduction is more important than specific wavelength filtering.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Marketing vs science" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Most blue light product claims far exceed the evidence. Be skeptical.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## What actually helps

If you're concerned about eye health and sleep, evidence supports these strategies:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Monitor your blink rate">
    This directly addresses the actual cause of screen-related eye strain. Tools like EyeRhythm can help you stay aware.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Optimize your environment">
    Proper humidity (45-55% RH), good lighting without glare, and appropriate screen position do more than any lens coating.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Dim screens in evening">
    Reducing overall brightness is more effective than color filters alone.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Take meaningful breaks">
    Regular breaks from screen focus help more than any passive intervention.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Don't waste money on expensive blue-blocking glasses for eye strain. Instead, [download EyeRhythm](/download) and address the actual cause: your blink rate.
