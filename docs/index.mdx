## How it works

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Detection" icon="eye">
    Your webcam feed is analyzed by MediaPipe, Google's on-device machine learning framework. It detects your eye movements and calculates your <Tooltip tip="Eye Aspect Ratio - a mathematical formula that measures the openness of your eyes">EAR</Tooltip> to accurately identify blinks.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Calibration" icon="sliders">
    EyeRhythm calibrates to your unique blink patterns. During setup, it learns your baseline blink rate and sets personalized thresholds for fatigue detection.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Alerts" icon="bell">
    When your blink rate drops significantly (a key indicator of eye fatigue and reduced focus), you'll receive a gentle notification to take a break.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Privacy" icon="shield-check">
    All processing happens locally on your device. Your video feed never leaves your computer, is never recorded, and is never uploaded anywhere.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
