# Privacy

<Tip>
  **TL;DR:** Your video never leaves your device. We can't see it. No one can. Period.
</Tip>

EyeRhythm was built from the ground up with privacy as a core principle. Unlike cloud-based eye tracking solutions, all processing happens entirely on your device.

## Our privacy promise

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="No video uploads" icon="cloud-arrow-up">
    Your webcam feed is processed locally and **never transmitted** anywhere
  </Card>
  <Card title="No recordings" icon="video-slash">
    We **don't record** video, images, or screenshots - ever
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## What data stays on your device

EyeRhythm stores minimal data locally to provide its features:

| Data | Purpose | Storage |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Session data** | Blink counts and timestamps for each tracking session | Browser localStorage |
| **Calibration settings** | Your personalized EAR threshold for accurate detection | Browser localStorage |
| **Preferences** | App settings like notification preferences and theme | Browser localStorage |

<Note>
  All this data stays on your computer. You can clear it anytime by deleting `~/Library/Application Support/EyeRhythm` on macOS.
</Note>

## How blink detection works (privately)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Camera feed capture">
    Your webcam provides a live video stream directly to the app
  </Step>
  <Step title="On-device AI processing">
    [MediaPipe](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe) (Google's on-device ML framework) analyzes each frame to detect 468 facial landmarks
  </Step>
  <Step title="Eye Aspect Ratio calculation">
    6 eye landmarks per eye are used to calculate EAR - a mathematical ratio that indicates whether eyes are open or closed
  </Step>
  <Step title="Blink detection">
    When EAR drops below your calibrated threshold then rises above it, a blink is registered
  </Step>
  <Step title="Only numbers are stored">
    Only the blink timestamp and count are saved - **no images, no video frames, no facial data**
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What we explicitly don't do

- **Upload video** anywhere - not to our servers, not to the cloud, not anywhere
- **Store video** on your device - the feed is processed in real-time and immediately discarded
- **Capture screenshots** or save frames from your camera
- **Require internet** for core functionality - blink tracking works completely offline
- **Sell data** - we don't have any data to sell

## Network requests

EyeRhythm makes minimal network requests:

| Request | Purpose | Can be disabled? |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| **MediaPipe model download** | Downloads ML models on first launch (~5MB) | No (required for detection) |
| **Auto-update check** | Checks GitHub for new versions | App works offline after install |

<Info>
  After the initial model download, EyeRhythm works completely offline. No internet connection required.
